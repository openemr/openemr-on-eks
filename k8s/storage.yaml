# =============================================================================
# OpenEMR Storage Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This file defines storage classes and persistent volume claims for OpenEMR.
#
# Storage Strategy:
# - EFS (Elastic File System) for shared application data (sites, SSL, backups)
# - EBS gp3 for time-series monitoring data (Prometheus, etc.)
# - ReadWriteMany access for multi-pod deployments
# - Encryption at rest for security
# =============================================================================
