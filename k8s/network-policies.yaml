# OpenEMR Network Security Policies
# =============================================================================
# This file defines Kubernetes Network Policies for OpenEMR security.
#
# Network Security Strategy:
# - Least privilege network access
# - Segregation between namespaces
# - Allow only necessary traffic flows
# - Protect against lateral movement
# =============================================================================

# Monitoring Network Policy
