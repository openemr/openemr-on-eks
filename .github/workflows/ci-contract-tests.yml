# Contract & Consistency Tests
# =============================================================================
# Lightweight workflow that validates cross-file consistency: version drift,
# Terraform output-to-script contracts, K8s manifest consistency, and schema
# validation. Runs on every push/PR and completes in ~3-5 minutes.
